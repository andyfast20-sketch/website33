## ❌ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Running .bat file from INSIDE the ZIP
```
❌ WRONG:
   Double-clicking ZIP → Seeing files → Double-clicking .bat
   (This won't work properly!)

✅ RIGHT:
   Right-click ZIP → Extract All → Open folder → Double-click .bat
```

### Mistake 2: Not extracting at all
```
❌ WRONG:
   Leaving it as a ZIP file

✅ RIGHT:
   Always extract/unzip first!
```

## 📍 Where Will Files Be?

**Default extraction location:**
```
C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\yourproject\
```

**You can move the extracted folder anywhere you want:**

## 🎓 Why Extract?

**Quick explanation:** A ZIP file is like a closed box. You need to open the box (extract) to use what's inside. Windows can show you what's in the ZIP, but programs can't run properly from inside a closed box!

**Think of it like:**
- ZIP = Suitcase (packed for travel)
- Extract = Unpacking (taking items out)
- You need to unpack before using things!

**Remember: Download → Extract → Run! That's the secret!** 🔑
